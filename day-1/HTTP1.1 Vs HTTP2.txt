Difference between HTTP 1.1 and HTTP 2:

I. HTTP 1.1:

II. HTTP 2:

1) Plain Text vs Binary Format:

I. HTTP 1.1: Works with plain text to transfer client data.

II. HTTP 2: Utilizes a binary format and employs the SPDY protocol for transferring client data.

2) Compression:

I. HTTP 1.1: Uses self-compression.

II. HTTP 2: Implements compression through the HPACK protocol.

3) Connection Handling:

I. HTTP 1.1: Requires a TCP connection for both server and client, and this connection remains alive until the data transfer is complete.

II. HTTP 2: Utilizes a single TCP connection for improved efficiency.

4) Request-Response Handling:

I. HTTP 1.1: The client's HTTP request waits for the first HTTP response from the server before sending subsequent inline HTTP requests.

II. HTTP 2: Allows the client to continuously send HTTP requests, with responses arriving from the server asynchronously.
